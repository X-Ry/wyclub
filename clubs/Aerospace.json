  "description": "The Aerospace Club competes in the Team America Rocketry Challenge each year. The goal is to stimulate a productive love of engineering and rocket science in our journey to designing building and launching rockets. The benefit of the club comes from the appreciation of engineering that its members gets instilled with and this is valuable given the lack of such a program currently existing in Whitney Young. The club also designs and builds other projects such as gliders RC planes drones and recreational rockets!",
