  "description": "Chocolate Club is exactly like it sounds it's a club where students of different grade levels and friend groups can come together through their combined love of chocolate. With each meeting we try a new flavor of chocolate and compete in a Kahoot (for example: if we got our chocolate from Jamaica the Kahoot is all facts on Jamaica). This club provides a space for new for friendships to form and already developed ones to evolve!",
